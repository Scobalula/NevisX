# NevisX

NevisX is a tool for editing weapons while in-game. Unlike the previous Nevis, NevisX works with your existing tools and looks for updates to your GDTs, so you can edit assets in APE and have them sync directly in-game.

NevisX makes it easy to fine tune your stats such as recoil, state timers, damage, and ammo across your weapons.

# Features

* Syncs directly with your GDTs, so you can use APE instead of Nevis' previous clunky UI. 
* Syncs across sessions, NevisX will automatically re-attach to new instances of the game so you can leave it running.
* Supports all weapon types.
* Supports 99% of weapon settings that are simple float/numbers.

# How to use

* Download the zip file and extract it, then run the NevisX exe file, NevisX will automatically wait for changes to your gdts.

# Disclaimers

NevisX was made ultimately with me in mind, it will likely contain bugs, quirks, and war crimes, if you have a bug report to make be sure to be as discriptive as possible, your gdts, paths, where NevisX is stored, etc.
